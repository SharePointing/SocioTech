# WW3
A Place to join the fight somewhere that we can govern, openly, honestly, transparently and for the public good. 

Most activity right now is in [the wiki](https://github.com/SharePointing/WW3/wiki), eventually this will be an artifact respository to hold important things taht need revision over time. 

Everyone is so roiling with righeous anger that they are ready to go to war, well, ok, let's do it then, but int he Digital Sphere, becuase if we go to war in the physical sphere, we are lost, and much like others under the control of the machine, subjugation is the certain fate. 

We are going to go through a journey together, to establish a common baseline, I'm sure much of what I have here is wrong, and I welcome healthy and reasoned debates that help enlighten me to a better truth, that makes our desired system compile, and then i'll gladly make those changes when they fit, as a group, with reasoned debate, but right now, when nothing can be trusted, the only thing we can trust is ourselves, and our faith in our fellow man. If we do not hold that, all is lost. 

Join me in this fight, I know not where it goes, only that it is a fight that must be waged. 

Let us begin, with the [Prelude to War](https://github.com/SharePointing/WW3/wiki/Prelude-to-War)
